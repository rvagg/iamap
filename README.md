# IAMap

An **I**mmutable **A**synchronous **Map**.

## Warning

This is both **experimental** and a **work in progress**. The current form is not likely to be the final form. No guarantees are provided that serialised versions of today's version will be loadable in the future. This project may even be archived if significantly improved forms are discovered or derived.

However, rich documentation is provided as an invitation for collaboration to work on that final form; or as inspiration for alternative approaches to this problem space.

_Caveat emptor for versions less than 1.0.0._

## About

IAMap provides a `Map`-like interface that can organise data in a storage system that does not lend itself to organisation, such as a content addressed storage system like [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) where you have to know the address of an element before you can fetch it.

As a single entity, an IAMap instance is a collection of elements which are either entries (or buckets / arrays of entries) or are references to child nodes which themselves are IAMap instances. Large collections will form a deep graph of IAMap nodes referenced by a single IAMap root instance. The entries are key/value pairs, where the values could either be plain JavaScript objects (as long as they are serialisable themselves) or be references to objects within the datastore (or perhaps elsewhere!). Each node in an IAMap graph of nodes is serialised into the datastore. Therefore, a single ID / address / reference to the root node is all that is required to find elements within the collection and collections may be _very_ large.

An IAMap is, therefore, a layer that provides a helpful key/value store on top of a storage system that does not inherently provide indexing facilities that allows easy fetch-by-key. In a content addressed store, such as IPFS, every item can only be fetched by its address, which is a hash of its content. Since those addresses may be derived from links within other pieces of content, we can build a data structure that becomes content and contains those links. Rather than `Store->Get(addressOfValue)` we can `Store->Get(iaMapRoot)->Get(key)` since there are many cases where `addressOfValue` is not known, or derivable ahead of time, but we can keep a single root address and use it to find any `key` within the generated IAMap structure.

The interface bears resemblance to a `Map` but with some crucial differences: asynchronous calls and immutability:

```js
// instantiate with a backing store and a hash function
let map = await iamap.create(store, { hashAlg: 'murmur3-32' })
// mutations create new copies
map = await map.set('foo', 'bar')
assert(await map.get('foo') === 'bar')
map = await map.delete('foo', 'bar')
assert(await map.get('foo') === null)
```

### IPLD

[IPLD](http://ipld.io/) is the data layer of IPFS. One aim of this project is to work toward useful primitives that will allow more complex applications to be built that do not necessarily relate to the current IPFS file-focused use-case.

While IAMap is intended to operate on top of IPLD, it is intentionally built independent from it such that it could be used across any other datastore that presents similar challenges to storing and retrieving structured data.

## Immutability

IAMap instances cannot be mutated, once instantiated, you cannot (or should not) modify its properties. Therefore, mutation requires the creation of new instances. Every `map.set()` and `map.delete()` operation will result in a new IAMap root node, which will have a new, unique identifier. New instances created by mutations essentially perform a copy-on-write (CoW), so only the modified node and its parents are impacted, all reference to unmodified nodes remain intact as links.

Mutation on a large data set may involve the creation of many new internal nodes, as references between nodes form part of the "content" and therefore require new identifiers. This is handled transparently but users should be aware that many intermediate nodes are created in a backing store during mutation operations.

## Consistency

IAMap instances are (or should be!) consistent for any given set of key/value pairs. This holds regardless of the order of `set()` operations or the use of `delete()` operations to derive the final form. When serialized in content addressable storage, an IAMap root node referencing the same set of key/value pairs should share the same identifier since their content is the same.

## Algorithm

IAMap implements a [Hash Array Mapped Trie (HAMT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie), it uses the mutation semantics the [CHAMP](https://michael.steindorfer.name/publications/oopsla15.pdf) (Com-pressed Hash-Array Mapped Prefix-tree) variant but adds buckets to entries and does not use separate `datamap` and `nodemap` properties, but rather a single `map` as per a traditional HAMT algorithm.

This implementation is related to the [Peergos](https://peergos.org/) [CHAMP Java implementaion](https://github.com/Peergos/Peergos/blob/master/src/peergos/shared/hamt/Champ.java) and the [implementation](https://github.com/msteindorfer/oopsla15-artifact/) provided with the original CHAMP OOPSLA'15 paper.

It is also similar to the current [go-hamt-ipld](https://github.com/ipfs/go-hamt-ipld/) and the intention is that this, and the Go IPLD implementation will converge via a shared specification such that they will be able to read each other's data stored in IPLD.

### Algorithm Summary

Keys are hashed when inserted, fetched, modified or deleted in a HAMT. Each node of a HAMT sits at a particular level, or "depth". Each depth takes a different section of the hash to determine an index for the key. e.g. if each level takes 8-bits of the hash, then depth=0 takes the first 8 bits to form an index, which will be from 0 to 255. At depth=1, we take the _next_ 8 bits to determine a new index, and so on, until a place for the entry is found. An entry is inserted at the top-most node that has room for it. Each node can hold as many _elements_ as the hash portion (or "prefix") allows. So if 8-bits are used for each level, then each node can hold 256 elements. In the case of IAMap, each of those elements can also be "buckets", or an array of elements. When a new element is inserted, the insertion first attempts at the root node, which is depth=0. The root node will be considered "full" if there is no space at the index determined by the hash at depth=0. A classic HAMT will be "full" if that index already contains an entry. In this implementation, "full" means that the bucket at that index has reached the maximum size allowed. Once full, the element at that index is replaced with a new child-node, whose depth is incremented. All entries previously in the bucket at that index are then inserted into this new child nodeâ€”however because the depth is incremented, a new portion of the hash of each element is used to determine its index. In this way, each node in the graph will contain a collection of either buckets (or entries) and references to child nodes. A good hash algorithm will distribute roughly evenly, making a densely packed data structure, where the density and height can be controlled by the number of bits of the hash used at each level and the maximum size of the buckets.

CHAMP adds some optimisations that increase performance on in-memory HAMTs (it's not clear that these extend to HAMTs that are backed by a non-memory datastore) and also delete semantics such that there is a canonical graph for any given set of key/value pairs. The CHAMP optimisation of separating `datamap` and `nodemap` is not applied here as the impact on traversal performance is only realisable for fully in-memory data structures.

Clear as mud? The code is heavily documented and you should be able to follow the algorithm in code form if you are so inclined.

## Examples

### [examples/memory-backed.js](./examples/memory-backed.js)

Use a JavaScript `Map` as an example backing store. IDs are created by `JSON.stringify()`ing the `toSerializable()` form of an IAMap node and taking a hash of that string.

Running this application will scan all directories within this repository and look for `package.json` files. If valid, it will store them keyed by `name@version`. Once the scan has completed, it will iterate over all entries of the IAMap and print out the `name@version` along with the `description` of each package.

This is not a realistic example because you can just use a `Map` directly, but it's useful for demonstrating the basics of how it works and can form the basis of something more sophisticated, such as a database-backed store.

### [examples/level-backed.js](./examples/level-backed.js)

A more sophisticated example that uses LevelDB to simulate a content addressable store. Objects are naively encoded as [CBOR](https://cbor.io/) and given [CIDs](https://github.com/multiformats/cid) via [ipld-dag-cbor](https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld-dag-cbor).

This example uses IAMap to crate an index of all module names `require()`'d by .js files in a given directory (and any of its subdirectories). You can then use that index to find a list of files that use a particular module.

The primary data structure uses IAMap to index lists of files by module name, so a `get(moduleName)` will fetch a list of files. To allow for large lists, the values in the primary IAMap are CIDs of secondary IAMaps, each of which is used like a Set to store arbitrarily large lists of files. So this example demonstrates IAMap as a standard Map and as a Set and there are as many Sets as there are modules found.

_(Note: directories with many 10's of thousands of .js files will be slow to index, be patient or try first on a smaller set of files.)_

<a name="iamap__create"></a>
### `async iamap.create(store, options)`

```js
let map = await iamap.create(store, options)
```

Create a new IAMap instance with a backing store. This operation is asynchronous and returns a `Promise` that
resolves to a `IAMap` instance.

**Parameters:**

* **`store`** _(`Object`)_: A backing store for this Map. The store should be able to save and load a serialised
  form of a single node of a IAMap which is provided as a plain object representation. `store.save(node)` takes
  a serialisable node and should return a content address / ID for the node. `store.load(id)` serves the inverse
  purpose, taking a content address / ID as provided by a `save()` operation and returning the serialised form
  of a node which can be instantiated by IAMap. In addition, a `store.isEqual(id1, id2)` method is required to
  check the equality of the two content addresses / IDs (which may be custom for that data type).
  The `store` object should take the following form: `{ async save(node):id, async load(id):node, isEqual(id,id):boolean }`
* **`options`** _(`Object`)_: Options for this IAMap
  * **`options.hashAlg`** _(`string`)_: A [multicodec](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv)
    hash function identifier, e.g. `'murmur3-32'`. Hash functions must be registered with [`iamap.registerHasher`](#iamap__registerHasher).
  * **`options.bitWidth`** _(`number`, optional, default=`5`)_: The number of bits to extract from the hash to form a data element index at
    each level of the Map, e.g. a bitWidth of 5 will extract 5 bits to be used as the data element index, since 2^5=32,
    each node will store up to 32 data elements (child nodes and/or entry buckets). The maximum depth of the Map is
    determined by `floor((hashBytes * 8) / bitWidth)` where `hashBytes` is the number of bytes the hash function
    produces, e.g. `hashBytes=32` and `bitWidth=5` yields a maximum depth of 51 nodes. The maximum `bitWidth`
    currently allowed is `8` which will store 256 data elements in each node.
  * **`options.bucketSize`** _(`number`, optional, default=`8`)_: The maximum number of collisions acceptable at each level of the Map. A
    collision in the `bitWidth` index at a given depth will result in entries stored in a bucket (array). Once the
    bucket exceeds `bucketSize`, a new child node is created for that index and all entries in the bucket are
    pushed

<a name="iamap__load"></a>
### `async iamap.load(store, id)`

### `iamap.registerHasher(hashAlg, hashBytes, hasher)`

```js
iamap.registerHasher(hashAlg, hashBytes, hasher)
```

Register a new hash function. IAMap has no hash functions by default, at least one is required to create a new
IAMap.

**Parameters:**

* **`hashAlg`** _(`string`)_: A [multicodec](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv) hash
  function identifier, e.g. `'murmur3-32'`.
* **`hashBytes`** _(`number`)_: The number of bytes to use from the result of the `hasher()` function (e.g. `32`)
* **`hasher`** _(`function`)_: A hash function that takes a `Buffer` derived from the `key` values used for this
  Map and returns a `Buffer` (or a `Buffer`-like, such that each data element of the array contains a single byte value).

<a name="IAMap"></a>
### `class IAMap`

  key is not found in this `IAMap`, the `Promise` will resolve to `null`.

<a name="IAMap_has"></a>
### `async IAMap#has(key)`

Asynchronously find and return a boolean indicating whether the given `key` exists within this `IAMap`

**Parameters:**

* **`key`** _(`string|array|Buffer|ArrayBuffer`)_: A key to check for existence within this `IAMap`. See
  [`IAMap#set`](#IAMap_set) for details about acceptable `key` types.

**Return value**  _(`Promise.<boolean>`)_: A `Promise` that resolves to either `true` or `false` depending on whether the `key` exists
  within this `IAMap`.

<a name="IAMap_delete"></a>
### `async IAMap#delete(key)`

Asynchronously create a new `IAMap` instance identical to this one but with `key` and its associated
value removed. If the `key` does not exist within this `IAMap`, this instance of `IAMap` is returned.

**Parameters:**

  format they were inserted via `set()`.

<a name="IAMap_values"></a>

traversal of all nodes.

**Return value**  _(`AsyncIterator`)_: An async iterator that yields values.

<a name="IAMap_entries"></a>
### `async IAMap#entries()`

Asynchronously emit all { key, value } pairs that exist within this `IAMap`, including its children. This will
cause a full traversal of all nodes.

**Return value**  _(`AsyncIterator`)_: An async iterator that yields objects with the properties `key` and `value`.

<a name="IAMap_ids"></a>
### `async IAMap#ids()`

Asynchronously emit the IDs of this `IAMap` and all of its children.

**Return value**  _(`AsyncIterator`)_: An async iterator that yields the ID of this `IAMap` and all of its children. The type of ID is
  determined by the backing store which is responsible for generating IDs upon `save()` operations.

<a name="IAMap_toSerializable"></a>
### `IAMap#toSerializable()`

Returns a serialisable form of this `IAMap` node. The internal representation of this local node is copied into a plain
JavaScript `Object` including a representation of its data array that the key/value pairs it contains as well as
the identifiers of child nodes.
Root nodes (depth==0) contain the full map configuration information, while intermediate and leaf nodes contain only
data that cannot be inferred by traversal from a root node that already has this data (hashAlg, bitWidth and bucketSize).
The backing store can use this representation to create a suitable serialised form. When loading from the backing store,
`IAMap` expects to receive an object with the same layout from which it can instantiate a full `IAMap` object. Where
root nodes contain the full set of data and intermediate and leaf nodes contain just the required data.
For content addressable backing stores, it is expected that the same data in this serialisable form will always produce
the same identifier.
Note that the `map` property is a `Buffer` so will need special handling for some serialization forms (e.g. JSON).

Root node form:
```
{
  hashAlg: string
  bitWidth: number
  bucketSize: number
  map: Buffer
  data: Array
}
```

Intermediate and leaf node form:
```
{
  map: Buffer
  data: Array
}
```

Where `data` is an array of a mix of either buckets or links:

* A bucket is an array of two elements, the first being a `key` of type `Buffer` and the second a `value`
  or whatever type has been provided in `set()` operations for this `IAMap`.
* A link is an Object with a single key `'link'` whose value is of the type provided by the backing store in
  `save()` operations.

**Return value**  _(`Object`)_: An object representing the internal state of this local `IAMap` node, including its links to child nodes
  if any.

<a name="IAMap_directEntryCount"></a>
### `IAMap#directEntryCount()`

Calculate the number of entries locally stored by this node. Performs a scan of local buckets and adds up
their size.

**Return value**  _(`number`)_: A number representing the number of local entries.

<a name="IAMap_directNodeCount"></a>
### `IAMap#directNodeCount()`

Calculate the number of child nodes linked by this node. Performs a scan of the local entries and tallies up the
ones containing links to child nodes.

**Return value**  _(`number`)_: A number representing the number of direct child nodes

<a name="IAMap_isInvariant"></a>
### `async IAMap#isInvariant()`

Asynchronously perform a check on this node and its children that it is in canonical format for the current data.
As this uses `size()` to calculate the total number of entries in this node and its children, it performs a full
scan of nodes and therefore incurs a load and deserialisation cost for each child node.
A `false` result from this method suggests a flaw in the implemetation.

**Return value**  _(`Promise.<boolean>`)_: A Promise with a boolean value indicating whether this IAMap is correctly formatted.

<a name="IAMap_fromChildSerializable"></a>
### `IAMap#fromChildSerializable(store, id, serializable[, depth])`

* **`id`** _(`Object`)_: An optional ID for the instantiated IAMap node. See [`iamap.fromSerializable`](#iamap__fromSerializable).
* **`serializable`** _(`Object`)_: The serializable form of an IAMap node to be instantiated.

### `iamap.isSerializable(serializable)`

Determine if a serializable object is an IAMap node type, can be used to assert whether a data block is
an IAMap node before trying to instantiate it.
This should pass for both root nodes as well as child nodes

**Parameters:**

* **`serializable`** _(`Object`)_: An object that may be a serialisable form of an IAMap node

**Return value**  _(`boolean`)_: An indication that the serialisable form is or is not an IAMap node

<a name="iamap__fromSerializable"></a>
### `iamap.fromSerializable(store, id, serializable[, options][, depth])`

Instantiate an IAMap from a valid serialisable form of an IAMap node. The serializable should be the same as
produced by [`IAMap#toSerializable`](#IAMap_toSerializable).
Serialised forms of root nodes must satisfy both [`iamap.isRootSerializable`](#iamap__isRootSerializable) and [`iamap.isSerializable`](#iamap__isSerializable). For
root nodes, the `options` parameter will be ignored and the `depth` parameter must be the default value of `0`.
Serialised forms of non-root nodes must satisfy [`iamap.isSerializable`](#iamap__isSerializable) and have a valid `options` parameter and
a non-`0` `depth` parameter.

**Parameters:**

* **`store`** _(`Object`)_: A backing store for this Map. See [`iamap.create`](#iamap__create).
* **`id`** _(`Object`)_: An optional ID for the instantiated IAMap node. Unlike [`iamap.create`](#iamap__create),
  `fromSerializable()` does not `save()` a newly created IAMap node so an ID is not generated for it. If one is
  required for downstream purposes it should be provided, if the value is `null` or `undefined`, `node.id` will
  be `null` but will remain writable.
* **`serializable`** _(`Object`)_: The serializable form of an IAMap node to be instantiated
* **`options`** _(`Object`, optional, default=`null`)_: An options object for IAMap child node instantiation. Will be ignored for root
  node instantiation (where `depth` = `0`) See [`iamap.create`](#iamap__create).
* **`depth`** _(`number`, optional, default=`0`)_: The depth of the IAMap node. Where `0` is the root node and any `>0` number is a child
  node.
